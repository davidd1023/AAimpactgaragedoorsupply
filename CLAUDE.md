# AA Impact Garage Door Supply — project facts

## The spring calculator (`spring_engineering`)

### Only ONE Duplex spring ID is used: `3 3/4" inside 6"`

Stated by the owner, 2026-10-07: *"we are only using 3 3/4\" inside 6\" spring id,
please permanently remember that."*

This is why the dropdown offers that pair alone. Three others used to be listed and
**all three gave wrong answers**, because every one of the 8,464 reference readings
behind the model is for `3 3/4" inside 6"`:

| option | what the reference said | what we said |
|---|---|---|
| `2 5/8" inside 5 1/4"` | 0.2625/0.1875, 15" / 16" | 0.2625/0.1875, **17" / 18"** |
| `3 1/2" inside 5 1/2" (Raynor)` | **0.25/0.207**, 15" / 16" | 0.2625/0.1875, **17" / 18"** |
| `3 3/8" inside 5 7/8" (Overhead)` | never measured | aliased to 2 5/8 inside 5 1/4 |

Two inches of length and the wrong wire on the Raynor pair - and the aliases that
mapped Raynor and Overhead onto `2 5/8" inside 5 1/4"` were simply wrong, which the
reference showed by giving a different wire size for the same door.

**Do not re-add a pair to the dropdown without calibrating it first.** Calibrating
one took thousands of reference readings; see `spring_engineering/dev/README.md`.
Offering a size the model cannot compute is worse than not offering it.

### Only the three visible Single spring IDs are used

Stated earlier by the owner: *"we are not using all of the single spring id's only
the ones that are visible to the user"* - which is `2 5/8"`, `3 3/4"` and `5 1/4"`.
All three agree with the reference exactly on the case checked.

### 6" is priced as 5 1/4"

Stated by the owner: *"6\" is the same as 5 1/4\""* for cone pricing.

## Pricing

- Cone and steel COSTS live in `spring_engineering/pricing.py`, server side. They
  were in the JavaScript and therefore in the public bundle, which also made the
  markup a division away from any quote.
- The markup and the flat labour charge are `ir.config_parameter` values, editable
  in Website > Configuration > Settings. The browser is never told the markup; it
  receives rates with it already applied.
- The labour charge is flat per assembly and added AFTER the markup.

## Git

Never `git push`. Use `odoosh-push`.
